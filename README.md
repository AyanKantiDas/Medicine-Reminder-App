The "Add Medicine" screen in this app is designed for users to set up a detailed medication reminder by providing essential inputs. Here’s a breakdown of each function available on this screen:

1. Medicine Name Field: Users enter the name of the medicine in this text field. The character limit is 20, ensuring concise entries. The input is required, indicated by the asterisk (*).
   
2. Dosage in mg Field: This field allows users to specify the dosage amount in milligrams (mg). Like the name field, it is limited to 20 characters and is mandatory.

3. Medicine Type Selection:
   The user can select the form of medication by choosing one of the icons representing Pill, Bottle, Syringe, or Tablet. Each icon is visually distinct, allowing for easy identification. This selection helps categorize the medication reminder according to the type of 
   medicine the user needs to take.

4. Interval Selection:
    This drop-down menu enables users to choose the frequency for the medication reminder (e.g., every 4, 6, 8 or 12 hours). The interval setup ensures the reminder will repeat according to the chosen time frame. This field is required, as noted by the asterisk.

5. Starting Time:
   The Select Time button opens a time picker, letting users set the initial time for their medication reminder. The reminder will trigger at this specified time, aligning with the selected interval thereafter.

6. Confirm Button:
   Once all required fields (medicine name, dosage, type, interval, and starting time) are completed, users tap this button to save their reminder settings. This action confirms the addition of the medication to the reminder schedule, which is then updated on the main 
   counter (i.e is the first page). 

This layout and functionality ensure that users can set up medication reminders in a structured and user-friendly way, enabling them to stay on track with their health routines.

    a. Composition: The active ingredients and their quantities within the medicine.

    b. Uses: The primary purposes and conditions for which the medicine is prescribed or used.

    c. Side Effects: Possible side effects and adverse reactions associated with the medicine.
